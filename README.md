# NYC Subway Crime Analysis
This project utilizes NYPD Complaint Data to analyze crime rates in relation to New York City subway stations. Through a combination of Python, Alteryx, and Tableau, we've created visual representations of crime rates compared to subway ridership volumes, providing insights into safety conditions for subway employees and riders.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning: Used Python and Alteryx to clean and transform the NYPD Complaint Data for analysis.

Crime Visualization: Created a color-coded map of NYC using Tableau, highlighting areas with higher reported crimes.

Suggesting Solution: Utilized our findings to suggest some solutions like increased policing or security system enhancements in high-crime areas.
This project aims to provide data-driven insights to aid in the improvement of public safety in New York City. However, it's important to note that our analysis is based on reported crimes, which may not fully capture the reality of crime in the city. These insights should therefore be used in conjunction with other information and approaches to public safety.
